USE CASE TYPE:
Transactional

---

DESCRIPTION OF USE CASE:

We are building a custom booking backend for Balkan Barbershop (balkanbarbershop.com), a professional barbershop located in Jersey City, NJ. 

Customers book haircut and shave appointments through our online booking system and provide their email during registration. We use these emails strictly to send transactional messages including:

- Booking confirmations when appointments are created
- Appointment reminders (24 hours and 2 hours before scheduled time)
- Cancellation confirmations
- Rescheduling notifications
- Account verification emails
- Password reset emails
- Admin/staff booking notifications

No marketing or promotional emails will be sent. All communications are directly related to appointments booked by customers.

The website (balkanbarbershop.com) is hosted on Squarespace, but we have full DNS access and permission from the domain owner to configure SPF, DKIM, and SES verification records. The domain identity has been verified through TXT and CNAME (DKIM) records.

---

HOW EMAIL ADDRESSES ARE OBTAINED:

Only customers who voluntarily enter their email during the booking registration process receive emails. Customers explicitly consent to receive transactional notifications about their appointments during account creation. 

Email addresses are:
- Collected directly from users during registration
- Never purchased, scraped, or imported from third parties
- Used only for appointment-related transactional messages
- Not shared with third parties

We do not use or maintain any third-party email lists.

---

HANDLING OF BOUNCES AND COMPLAINTS:

We have configured Amazon SNS to receive email feedback notifications from SES:
- SNS Topic ARN: arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:364301298768:ses-bounce-complaint-feedback
- This topic is configured to receive both bounce and complaint notifications

Our system automatically processes these notifications to:
1. Suppress further emails to addresses that hard bounce
2. Remove addresses that generate complaints
3. Monitor bounce rates to maintain sender reputation
4. Log all bounce/complaint events for audit purposes

We will maintain bounce rates below 5% and complaint rates below 0.1% as required by AWS policies.
